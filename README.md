## How it works
- Utilizes Pepper's Ghost illusion to display a projected hologram of Castform
     * Read more about Pepper's Ghost **[here](https://www.artofplay.com/blogs/stories/spectral-illusions-the-peppers-ghost-effect-and-how-it-works)**
- HTML + Javascript files display Castform and dynamically changes its form according to real-time weather data retrieved from OpenWeatherMap API
- Deployed this local site on Raspberry Pi, running in fullscreen mode of Chromium browser
